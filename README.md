# gitlet
A project for Data Structures and Algorithms (CS61B), UC Berkeley's second introductory computer science course.

The project involves creating a version control system which mimics some of the basic features of Git, as well as some additional features. The features implemented are init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log, find, status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, and merge.

**Note:** this repo only contains the design documentation for the project. To view all project files, please request access to the full-gitlet repo.
